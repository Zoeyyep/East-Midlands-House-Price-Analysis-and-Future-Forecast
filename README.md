# East-Midlands-House-Price-Analysis-and-Future-Forecast
This report focuses on analyse a dataset of monthly average house prices in the East Midlands form 2010 to 2019. This report is a reference for the local government agency. As a result, we will forecast monthly house prices for the first six months of 2020 using the time series. After several model tests we chose the ARIMA(1, 1, 2) Ã— (0, 1, 1) [12] model, which predicts that house prices will still show an upward trend in the first six months of 2020.
